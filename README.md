# Jeopardy-game-UPE

This is an explanation of how the game works. 

It starts off in the main page (named game.html). When the user clicks on start game, they are redirected to the course page where they can choose which course they want to play. Then they can put the number of players and their names. After that, they are redirected to the questions page (named main.html). Here, they can choose which question from whichever category they want to answer. When the question appears, the user can choose which player will answer the question, and if correct, the number of points for that particular question will be added to the overall score of the player, which is then displayed in the questions page.

There are a few things that should be fixed in this code. There is the general structuring and formatting of the page, where some text appears slightly to the left rather than aligned at the center. Also, the player names are not displayed in the main questions page. I am currently working on fixing that, where I found that changing the names interferes with the scoring system. Due to the lack of time, I am submitting the code as it is right now, and I will hopefully fix these points soon.
